# Welcome to My Awesome World! ðŸš€
 I am Rajneesh AKA Raj (Chapee)
 
## ðŸŒŸ About Me
I engage in the art of creation, a visionary who believes in the power of building visionary products. See you on Mars 

ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ

Hey there! I'm Rajneesh, your friendly neighborhood developer. I'm passionate about coding, creating cool stuff, and drinking way too much coffee (Coffee is a lie I don't drink too much I used to). When I'm not glued to my computer screen, you can find me exploring the outdoors(again outdoors is a lie, the truth is am 90% time glued to my PC or MAC), trying out new recipes (with varying degrees of success), or attempting to learn how to juggle (still a work in progress). 

## What am working on?
Currently, I am engaged in client projects as well as personal endeavors. Additionally, I am excited to announce that the launch of my inaugural SaaS product, developed under my company Grapdevs, is imminent.
